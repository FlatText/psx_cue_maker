    <h1>Autogenerate the missing CUE file for your PSX emulation bins.</h1>
    <p>Emulating games is great fun, but while SNES, NES and Genesis games are easy to find and run, PlayStation games are a bit more complicated. Unlike the others, they come in a dozen of different disc formats.</p>
    <p>Most commonly, you'll find PSX games distributed as a zip-file and inside you'll find one or more bin files. However, in order for emulators or virtual drive managers to load your game correctly, you often need a CUE-file. If you attempt to load the first bin directly, it will often work, but background music will be missing.</p>
    <p>By studying the cue file syntax, you can write a suitable cue file for your bins in notepad, but who wants to spend time fiddleling with that, when it can be automated?</p>
    <hr />
    <p>Drag your bin files onto the dropzone below and have the cue sheet generated automatically. Your files will <strong>not</strong> be uploaded or anything. The dropzone is used to read the filenames of the bins, so this webpage can generate a cue sheet for you.</p>
